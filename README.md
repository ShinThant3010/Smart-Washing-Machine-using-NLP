# Smart-Washing-Machine-using-NLP

### Project Description
- A simple NLP group project is implemented with three members. 
- User's instruction for the specific options for a washing machine is taken in Natural Language. 
- The input instruction is framed with specific grammar. 

### Dataset
- created more than 100 example instructions based on all possible actions of the washing machine. Our work focused on a real manual from the Electrolux 24'' Compact Washer with LuxCare Wash System - 2.4 Cu. Ft. which is a front load washing machine. 

### Methodology
- The desired settings are extracted in a rule-based manner based on the dependency tree and POS tags.
